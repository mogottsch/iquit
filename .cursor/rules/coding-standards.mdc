# Coding Standards

1. No comments ever. Code must be self-explanatory. If code appears to need comments, it's too complex and should be split into smaller functions with descriptive names.

2. Use linters and precommit hooks. Check for linter errors after each large change, every time.

3. Prefer functional programming over OOP, but remain pragmatic with implementation choices.

4. Small functions are always preferred over large ones. Break down complex logic into smaller, well-named functions.

5. Use strict typing wherever possible. Avoid any and unknown types unless absolutely necessary.
